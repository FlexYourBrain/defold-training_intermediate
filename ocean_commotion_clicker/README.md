# OCEAN COMMOTION CLICKER
This project is a test-bed for toying with clicker game mechanics.

# SUGGESTED EXERCISES
* Change the board setup so it generates a board with guaranteed groups of two or more fish.
* Add scoring for various kinds of fish and groups of fish
* Add more combinations and special fish
* It is currently possible to mess with the data by clicking while the game is resolving a previous click. Solve that.
